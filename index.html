  <h1>Testing arbor.js network visualization</h1>
  <p>When you download the sourcecode of this file and open the index.html in your browser locally you can see a newtwork graph, everything works perfectly. But it just wont work when its in production. I have 3 script tags included here, first i load jqury, then i load the ardorjs minified js file from here https://dl.dropbox.com/s/y2msq2ttbxeu2qo/arbor.js and at the end is my own code for a simple graph which is hosted here: https://dl.dropbox.com/s/578qe4k75xi9209/main.js. Any ideas how this can be resolved?</p>
